Using Wang's algorithm to prove  theorems in propositional calculus
# Important Notes:
1-Needs more testing especially on inputs with chained connectors  
2-Second termination condition for the Axiom-checker is not available  
3-Needs to be sure that there are no memory leaks  
4-The functions are too big and can be chopped to smaller parts  
5-Needs debugging
